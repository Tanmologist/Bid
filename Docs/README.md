# Project Docs

This folder contains guidance Markdown documents for the project. AI assistants can treat any `.md` file here as non-runtime instructional material (not game code). Follow in-code rules:

- All code comments, variable names, prints: English only.
- Server creates RemoteEvents first; clients only wait.
- Do not create new files/folders without approval.
- Only ModuleScripts (`.luau`) return values; `.server.luau` / `.client.luau` do not return.

Additional documents placed here are meant for human / AI reference and MUST NOT be required from runtime scripts.
